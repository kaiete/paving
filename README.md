# Paving
### The homepage for all
<details><summary>Why paving?</summary>
<ul>
<li>It's faster to load because it's a very small file</li>
<li>When you search it uses DuckDuckGo, the search engine that doesn't track you</li>
<li>It doesn't have a despicable design, but if you just change the default search engine<br>to something other than Google in Chrome, your homepage is suddenly very ugly</li>
<li>It has a very minimal design - good for minimalists</li>
</ul>
